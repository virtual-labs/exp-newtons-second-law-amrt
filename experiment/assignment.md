## Assignment

<ol>
  <li>A cart of mass 50 g and hanging weight 5 g are attached as shown in the simulator. The coefficient of friction is 0.002. What is the acceleration of the cart? When an additional 5 g is added to the hanging weight, what happens to its acceleration?</li>

  <li>Set the pointer distance on the simulator to 75 cm. The masses of the cart and hanging weight should both be equal to 10 g. The coefficient of friction is set to 0.002. Calculate the time it will take the cart to reach 75 cm.</li>

  <li>Using the simulator, add a 10 g mass to the hanging weight and adjust the mass of the cart to 20 g. The coefficient of friction is 0.004. Calculate the time interval required for the cart to cover a distance of 70 cm.</li>

  <li>Draw a graph connecting the time taken and the distance travelled by a cart whose mass is 30 g and hanging weight is 25 g. The coefficient of friction is 0.003.</li>

  <li>A cart of mass 40 g and hanging weight 10 g is attached, and the coefficient of friction is adjusted to 0.001. What is the distance covered by the cart in 1 second?</li>
