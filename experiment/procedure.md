## Procedure


### Performing the simulation:
 

#### Variable Region:
1. **Change Friction:**

This slider helps you change the Coefficient of Friction of the surface.

2. **Change hanging weight:**

This slider helps you to change the hanging weight. The change will be in grams.

3. **Change cart weight:**

This slider helps you to change the cart weight. The change will be in grams.

4. **Change pointer position:**

This slider is used to change the position of the pointer. The pointer is used to measure and calculate the time for reaching the pointer position.

5. **Start Button:**

This button is used to start the movement of the cart.

6. **Reset Button:**

This button is used to reset the cart to the initial position.

 

#### Measurement Region:
 

1. Time taken to reach the pointer will show the time taken by the cart to reach the pointer position in seconds.

2. The pointer distance will show the pointer position distance.

3. The acceleration shows the acceleration of the cart.
